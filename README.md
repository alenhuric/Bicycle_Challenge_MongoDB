# Alen's Bicycle Challenge

I am revisiting the bicycle challenge project and making some significant changes. Instead of using a MySQL database, I am now incorporating a MongoDB, which offers a more flexible and scalable approach for this project. Additionally, I am implementing testing for various classes to ensure comprehensive code coverage and improve the overall quality of the project. These enhancements will enable us to deliver a more robust and reliable web application.




To connect a database to the project, follow these steps:
- Install MongoDB.
- Create a new database named "bicyclechallenge" in MongoDB.
- Start the MongoDB server to ensure it's running and ready to accept connections.
- Run the command symfony **server:start** to start the project's server.
